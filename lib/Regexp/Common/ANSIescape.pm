=head1 NAME

Regexp::Common::ANSIescape -- regexps for ANSI terminal escapes

=for test_synopsis my ($str)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Regexp::Common 'ANSIescape', 'no_defaults';

 if ($str =~ /$RE{ANSIescape}/) {
    # ...
 }

 my $re1 = $RE{ANSIescape}{-only7bit};
 my $re2 = $RE{ANSIescape}{-sepstring};

=head1 DESCRIPTION

See L<Regexp::Common> for the basics of C<Regexp::Common> patterns.  An
ANSIescape pattern matches an ANSI terminal escape sequence like

    Esc[30;48m             # CSI sequence
    Esc[?1h                # CSI with private params
    EscU                   # C1 control
    Esc_ APPSTRING Esc\    # C1 with string param

    \x9B 30m               # ditto in 8-bit intro
    \x9B ?1h
    \x85
    \x9F APPSTRING \x9C

The 7-bit patterns are Esc followed by various combinations of printable
ASCII C<"\x20"> through C<"\x7E">.

The 8-bit forms use bytes C<"\x80"> through C<"\x9F">.  The C<-only7bit>
option below can omit the 8-bit patterns if they might have another
meaning:

=over 4

=item *

ISO-8859 character sets such as Latin-1 don't use C<\x80> through C<\x9F>,
so they're free to be the ANSI escapes.

=item *

Unicode code points C<\x80> through C<\x9F> have the ANSI meaning, so Perl
wide-char strings on ASCII systems are fine (but not EBCDIC systems).

=item *

UTF-8 encoding uses bytes C<\x80> through C<\x9F> as intermediate parts of
normal characters, so must either decode to code points first, or use
C<-only7bit>.

=item *

Other encodings may use C<\x80> through C<\x9F> as characters, eg. DOS code
page 1252 extension of Latin-1.  Generally C<-only7bit> should be used in
that case.

=back

=for ProhibitUnbalancedParens allow next

The parameter part like "0" in "Esc[0m" can be any bytes 0x30 through 0x3F,
so "private parameter" values like the VT100 "DECSET" extensions are
matched.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item C<{-only7bit}>

=item C<{-only8bit}>

Match only the 7-bit forms like C<"\eE">.  Or match only the 8-bit forms
like C<"\x{85}">.  The default is to match both.  The 7-bit forms are the
most common.

=item C<{-sepstring}>

By default the string parameter to APC, DCS, OSC, PM and SOS is included in
the match, for example an APC like the following is matched in its entirety.

    \x{9F}Stringarg\x{9C}

With C<-sepstring> the pattern instead matches the start "\x{9F}" and the
terminator "\x{9C}" individually, with the C<Stringarg> part unmatched.

In both cases the strings can be any characters through to the first ST
form.  The ANSI standard restricts the characters allowed in the "command
string" of APC, DCS, OSC and PM, whereas anything can be a "character
string" to SOS.  The "command string" restrictions are not enforced by
ANSIescape, currently.

=item C<{-keep}>

With the standard C<-keep> option grouping parens are included in the
regexps to set the following capture variables

=over 4

=item C<$1>

The entire escape sequence.

=item C<$2>

The parameters to a CSI sequence.  For example

    \e[30;49m    ->   30;49      (SGR)
    \e[?5h       ->   ?5         (DECSCNM extension)

=item C<$3>

Intermediate characters (if any) and final character of a CSI escape.  For
example

    \e[30m       ->   m
    \e[30+P      ->   +P

=back

=head1 IMPORTS

ANSIescape should be loaded through the C<Regexp::Common> mechanism, see
L<Regexp::Common/Loading specific sets of patterns.>.  Remember that loading
a non-builtin pattern like ANSIescape also loads all the builtin patterns.

    # ANSIescape plus all builtins
    use Regexp::Common 'ANSIescape';

If you want only C<$RE{ANSIescape}> then add C<no_defaults> (or a specific
set of desired builtins).

    # ANSIescape alone
    use Regexp::Common 'ANSIescape', 'no_defaults';
